Summary

My Notes

... a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better of 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determining the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits - not once in-a-lifetime transformation.

Productivity compounds (one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but counts for a lot over career)

Knowledge compounds (... each book opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. )

Relationships compound. Being a little nicer can result in strong connections.

...habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. ... But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau - what I call the _Plateau of Latent Potential_.

> When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before. - Jacob Riis

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the process that lead to those results. **If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.**

When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs fix themselves.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the _process_ that will determine your _progress_.

### How Your Habits Shape Your Identity

You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

* Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.

New identifies require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you've always cast, you're going to get the same results you've always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process.

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Ask yourself, "Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?"

Habits are not about having something. They are about _becoming_ someone.

... the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop - cue, craving, response, reward;

You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

### The Man Who Didn't Look Right

In order to change our habits we must be first aware of them. James provides couple of tools:

Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. If you want to cut back on eating cookies, before you are about to eat one, say out load, "I'm about about to eat this cookie, but I don't need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health."

The Habit Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

### The Best Way to Start a New Habit

People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. 

Two strategies

Implementation Intention is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.

Example: I will \[BEHAVIOR\] at \[TIME\] in \[LOCATION\]

Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.

Example: After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\]

These two strategies create obvious cues (1st Law of Behavior Change is to _make it obvious_)

### Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

Many of the actions we take every day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option. 

If you want to make a habit big part of your life, make cue a bit part of your environment. (multiple cues are better). Sprinkle triggers throughout your surroundings. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cue for good habits are right in front of you. 

Become an architect or designer of your life and not merely a consumer of it. 

It's easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in face of competing cues. 

"One space, one use". When you start mixing context, you'll start mixing habits - and the easier ones will usually win out. '

If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable. (My note: this is possibly impossible when you have kids)

### The Secret to Self-Control

Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower when you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.
