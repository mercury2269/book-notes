Summary 

My Notes

... a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better of 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determining the difference between who you are and who you could be. Success is the product of daily habits - not once in-a-lifetime transformation. 

Productivity compounds (one extra task is a small feat on any given day, but counts for a lot over career)

Knowledge compounds (... each book opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. )

Relationships compound. Being a little nicer can result in strong connections. 

...habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere. It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed.

This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. ... But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau - what I call the _Plateau of Latent Potential_.

> When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before. - Jacob Riis

Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the process that lead to those results. **If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.**
