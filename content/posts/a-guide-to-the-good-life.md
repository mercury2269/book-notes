> Our culture doesn't encourage people to think about such things (grand goal of living); indeede, it provides them with an endless stream of distractions so they won't ever have to. But a grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life.

> .. the second component of a philosophy of life is a strategy for attaining your grand goal in living. This strategy will specify what you must do, as you go, about your daily activities, to maximize your chances of graining the thing in life that you take to be ultimate value.

> ... the goal of the Stoics was not to banish emotion from life but to banish nagative emotions

> The Stoics fell somewhere between the Cyrenaics and the Cynics: They thought people should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, they thought we should periodically interrupt our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever we are enjoying. 

> Whatever philosophy of life a person ends up adopting, she will probably have a better life than if she tried to live -- as many people do -- without a coherent philosophy of life.

> The problem is that "bad men obey their lusts as servants obey their masters," and because they cannot control their desires, they can never find contentment.

> For the Stoics, a person's virtue does not depend, for example, on her sexual history. Instead, it depends on her excellence as a human being - on how well she performs the function for which humans were designed.

Two goals: attainment of virtue and the attainment of tranquility.

> ... Stoic tranquility was a phychological state marked by the absense of negative emotions, such as grief, anger, and anxiety, and the presence of positive emotions, such as joy.

> We should keep in mind that "all things everywhere are perishable." If we fail to recognize this and instead go around assuming that we will always be able to enjoy the things we value, we will likely find ourselves subject to considerable distress when the things we value are taken from us.

> One key to happiness, then, is to forestall the adaptation process: We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking for granted, once we get them, then things we worked so hard to get. And because we have probably failed to take such steps in the past, there are doubtless many things in our life to which we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of having but that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse, our children, our house, our car, and our job.

> the easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn hot to want the things we already have.

> They (Stoics) recommended that we spend time imagining that we have lost the things we value - that our wife has left us, our car was stolen, or we lost our job. Doing this, the Stoics thought. will make use value our wife, our car, and our job more than we otherwise would. This technique - let us refer to it as negative visualization - was employed by the Stoics at least as far back as Chrysippus. It is, I think, the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' psychological tool kit.

How often to practice negative visualizaiton? Few times a day or a few times per week.

Live today if it was our last day.

> As we go about our day we should periodically pause to reflect on the fact that we will not live forever and therefore that this day could be our last. Such reflection, rather than converting us into hedonists, will make us appreciate how wonderful it is that we are alive and have the opportunity to fill this day with activity. This in turn will make it less likely that we will squander our days.

> To be able to be satisfied with little is not a failing, it is a blessing - if, at any rate, what you seek is satisfaction.

> The negative visualization technique, by the way, can also be used in reverse: Besdies imagining that the bad things that happened to other happen to us, we can imagine that the bad things that happpened to others instead to others.

> A better strategy for getting what you want, he says (Epictetus), is to make it your goal to want only those things that are easy to obtain - and ideally to want only those things that you can be certain of obtaining. 

> wanting things that are not up to us will disrupt our tranquility

> It will clearly make sense for us to spend time and energy setting goals for ourselves and determining our values. Doing this will take relatively little time and energy. Furthermore, the reward for choosing our goals and values properly can be enormous. 

> ...set internal rather external goals. Thus, his goal of playing tennis will not be to win a match (something external, over which he has only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in the match (something internal, over which he has complete control).

Fatalism

> One of the things we've got, though, is this very moment, and we have an important choice with respect to it: We can either spend this moment wishing it could be different, or we can embrace this moment. If we habitually do the former, we will spend much of our life in a state of dissatisfaction; if we habitually do the latter, we will enjoy our life.

> ...intense pleasures, when captured by us, become our captors, meaning that the more pleasure a man captures, "the more masters will have to serve."

> we should abstain from those pleasures that can capture us in a single encounter: This would include the pleasure to be derived from certain drugs: ...

> conciously abstraining from pleasure can itself be pleasant. ... you will "be pleased and will praise yourself" fot not eating it. (an ice cream)
