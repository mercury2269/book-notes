> Wake up, wake up! You've grown up. You're too big to be asleep. Wake up! Stop playing with your toys.
>
> ... most of what we feel and think we conjure up for ourselves in our heads, including this business of being helped by people.
>
> We don't want to be unconditionally happy. I'm ready to be happy provided I have this and that and the other thing.
>
> So you must "receive" your demons, because when you fight them, you empower them.
>
> Do you want to change the world? How about beginning with yourself? How about being transformed yourself first? But how do you achieve that? Through observation. Through understanding. With no interference or judgement on your part. Because what you judge you cannot understand.
>
> No judgement, no commentary, no attitude: one simply observes, one studies, one watches, without the desire to change what is.
>
> A scientist observes the behavior of ants with no further end in view than to study ants, to learn as much as possible about them. He has no other aim. ... He's interested in ants, he wants to learn as much as possible about them. That's his attitude. The day you attain a posture like that, you will experience a miracle. You will change -- effortlessly, correctly.

> If you ever let yourself feel good when people tell you that you're O.K.,you are preparing yourself to feel bad when they tell you're not good.
>
> It's going to take a lot of awareness for your to understand that perhaps this thing you call "I" is simply a conglomeration of your past experiences, of your conditioning and programming.
>
> Self observation means watching -- observing whatever is going on in you and around you as if it were happening to someone else.
>
> Am I my thoughts, the thoughts that I am thinking? No. Thoughts come and go; I am not my thoughts. Am I my body?
>
> Could we say that "I" is non of the labels we attach to it? Labels belong to "me". What constantly changes is "me". Does "I" ever change. Does the observer ever change? The fact is that no matter what labels you think of (except perhaps human being) you should apply them to "me". "I" is none of these things.

> First, can you pick up the desire under that suffering. that there's something you desires very keenly or else you wouldn't be suffering. What is the desire? Second, it isn't simply a desire; there's an _identification_ there. You have somehow said to yourself, "The well-being of 'I', almost the existence of 'I', is tied up with the desire." All suffering is caused by my identifying myself with something, whether that something is within me or outside of me.
>
> Anytime you have a negative feeling toward anyone, you're living in an illusion. There's something seriously wrong with you. You're not seeing reality. Something inside of you has to change. But that do we generally do when we have a negative feeling? "He is to blame, she is to blame. She's got to change." No! The world's all right. The one who has to change is _you._
>
> Think about that. Because if you do, the next thing you will be doing, whether you're aware of it or not, is _demanding_ that other people contribute to your happiness. Then there will be a next step - fear, fear of loss, fear of alienation, fear of rejection, mutual control. Perfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are no demands, no expecations, no dependency. I do no demand that you make me happy; my happiness does not lies in you. If you were to leave me, I will not feel sorry for myself; I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling.
