> Because if the leader can't take the time to develop a clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn't thinking through all the way to the end, who is?

Story about Kennedy where he recently read a book _The Guns of August_, about world leaders rushing into a conflict. And he wanted for everyone to slow down during the missile crisis and think through the problem. (Thinking fast and slow)

In the critical situations we must:

> * Be Fully present.
> * Empty our mind of preconditions.
> * Take our time.
> * Sit quietly and reflect.
> * Reject distractions.
> * Weight advice against the counsel of our convictions.
> * Deliberate without being paralyzed.
>
> Tolstoy observed that love can't exist in the future. Love is only real if it's happening right now.

> Jesus told his disciples not to worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will take care of itself. Another way of saying that is: You have plenty on your plate right now. Focus on that, no matter how small or insignificant it is. Do the very best you can right now. Don't think about what detractors may say. Don't dwell or needlessly complicate. Be here. Be all of you.
>
> Be present.

> There is ego in trying to stay up on everything, ... There is ego in trying to appear the most informed person in the room, ... who knows every single thing that's happening in everyone's life.
>
> The point is, it's very difficult to think and act clearly (to say nothing of being happy) when we are drowning in information.
>
> In his Meditations, Markus Auerlius says, "Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'"
>
> Knowing what not thing about. What to ignore and not to do. It's your first and most important job.

> "Tao is in the emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind." Markus Aurelius once wrote that "cutting free of impressions that ling to the mind, free of the future and the past," to become the "sphere rejoicing in its perfect stillness"

> Appearances are misleading. First impressions are too. We are disturbed and deceived by what's on the surface, by whats others see. Then we make bad decisions, miss opportunities, or feel scared or upset. Particularly when we don't slow down and take the time to really look. 
>
> "Just be quite and think. It'll make all the difference in the world." - Rogers
>
> Your job, after you have emptied your mind, is to slow down and think. To really think, on a regular basis.
>
> ... Think about what's important to you, what's actually going on, what might be hidden from the view, what the rest of the chessboard looks like, what the meaning of life really is. 

> "How noble and good everyone could be if at the end of the day they were to review their own behavior and weight up the rights and wrongs. They would automatically try to do better at the start of each new day, and after a while, would certainly accomplish a great deal"
>
> Seneca explained to his friend, "I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by." Then he would go to bed, finding that "the sleep which follows this self-examination" was particularly sweet.
>
> Journaling is a way to ask tough questions: Where am I standing in my own way? What's the smallest step I can take toward a big thing today? Why am I so worked up about this? What blessings can I count right now? Why do I care so much about impressing people? What is the harder choice I'm avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do they rule me? How will today's difficulties reveal my character?

> We can't be afraid of silence, as it has much to teach us. Seek it. 

> what made Socrates so wise was that "he knew nothing except just the fact of his ignorance." 
>
> Both the Epicureans and the Stoics held sophia (wisdom) as a core tenet. 
>
> The noble person who studies widely and examines himself each day will become clear in his knowing and faultless in his conduct. 
>
> The need to ask questions. The need to study and reflect. The importance of intellectual humility. The power of experiences - most of all failures and mistakes - to open our eyes to truth and understanding.
>
> Find people who you admire and ask how they got where they are. Seek book recommendations. Isn't that what Socrates would do? Add experiences and experimentation to the top of this. Put yourself in tough situations. Accept challenges. Familiarize yourself with the unfamiliar. 

> Confident people know what matters. They know when to ignore other people's opinions. The don't boast or lie to get ahead (and then struggle to deliver). Confidence is the freedom to set your own standards and unshackles yourself from the need to prove yourself. A confident person doesn't fear disagreement and doesn't see change - swapping an incorrect opinion for a correct one - as an admission of inferiority. 

> The great archery master Awa Kenzo preferred to teach his students an important mental skill: detachment. "What stands in your way is that you have too much willful will. He wanted his student to detach from the idea of an outcome. "The hits on the target are only the outward proof and confirmation of your purposelessness at its highest, of your egolessness, your self abandonment, or whatever you like to call this state.
>
> Mastering our mental domain - as paradoxical as it might seem - requires us to step back from the rigidity of the word "mastery". We'll get the stillness we need if we focus on the individual steps, if we embrace the process, and give up chasing. We'll think better if we aren't thinking so hard. 
>
> The closer we get to mastery, the less we can about specific results. The more collaborative and creative we are able to be, the less we will tolerate ego or insecurity. The more at peace we are, the more productive we can be.
