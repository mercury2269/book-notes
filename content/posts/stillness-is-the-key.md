> Because if the leader can't take the time to develop a clear sense of the bigger picture, who will? If the leader isn't thinking through all the way to the end, who is?

Story about Kennedy where he recently read a book _The Guns of August_, about world leaders rushing into a conflict. And he wanted for everyone to slow down during the missile crisis and think through the problem. (Thinking fast and slow)

In the critical situations we must:

> * Be Fully present.
> * Empty our mind of preconditions.
> * Take our time.
> * Sit quietly and reflect.
> * Reject distractions.
> * Weight advice against the counsel of our convictions.
> * Deliberate without being paralyzed.
>
> Tolstoy observed that love can't exist in the future. Love is only real if it's happening right now. 

> Jesus told his disciples not to worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will take care of itself. Another way of saying that is: You have plenty on your plate right now. Focus on that, no matter how small or insignificant it is. Do the very best you can right now. Don't think about what detractors may say. Don't dwell or needlessly complicate. Be here. Be all of you.
>
> Be present. 

> There is ego in trying to stay up on everything, ... There is ego in trying to appear the most informed person in the room, ... who knows every single thing that's happening in everyone's life. 
>
> The point is, it's very difficult to think and act clearly (to say nothing of being happy) when we are drowning in information. 
>
> In his Meditations, Markus Auerlius says, "Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'"
>
> Knowing what not thing about. What to ignore and not to do. It's your first and most important job.
